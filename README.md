📚 MERN Stack Class Assignments
This repository contains all the class assignments and practice projects I’ve worked on during my MERN Stack web development classes.
It represents my journey from basic web fundamentals to more advanced full-stack concepts 🚀.

The classes started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics, and gradually moved towards building structured, real-world web applications.

🧭 Learning Journey
This repo reflects my step-by-step progress in web development:

🌱 Understanding HTML structure & semantics
🎨 Styling with CSS
⚙️ Adding interactivity using JavaScript
🧠 Learning how to think like a developer

🏗️ Building small but meaningful projects as assignments

Each project here was built as part of my classwork, not tutorials copied blindly — every folder represents hands-on practice and learning.
